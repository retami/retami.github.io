        <p style="width:400px;">The goal of the game is to crack the code in as few attempts as possible.
        The code is made up of 4 colors. Each color can be used multiple times. After each guess,
        you will get feedback in the form of black and white pins. A black pin means that you have
        guessed a color and its position correctly. A white pin means that you have guessed a color
        correctly, but not its position. You can use the hint button to reveal one of the colors in
        the code. Good luck!</p>
